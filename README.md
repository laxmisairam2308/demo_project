# demo_project
In this project, I leveraged the power of Terraform Provisioners and AWS to create an automated and consistent deployment pipeline for applications on Amazon EC2 instances.This project is an automation solution designed to simplify the deployment of applications on AWS EC2 instances. In this project, I am going to deploy a simple flask application.

**Note:**
By default, web browsers may try to access the application using **HTTPS** (`https://your-ip`), please remove the S and try to  access.

**EX: http://your-ip**

If your browser automatically redirects back to HTTPS, try opening the link in **Incognito/Private Mode** or clearing cached redirects.
